# African Inflation Rate data

This repository contains a notebook that consolidates information on African
inflation rates (sourced from the IMF). The code is in [africa\_inflation\_data.ipynb](africa_inflation_data.ipynb) - this notebook can also be viewed using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/africadatahub/adh-africa-inflation/blob/main/africa_inflation_data.ipynb).

The consolidated data is in the [data](/data) folder in [Excel](data/africa_inflation_data.xlsx), [CSV](data/africa_inflation_data.csv)
and [Parquet](data/africa_inflation_data.parquet) formats.

The data used here is from the  [IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH) under their [standard conditions](https://www.imf.org/external/terms.htm), from the [African Union](https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2) under their [standard conditions](https://au.int/en/legal_notice) and from GitHub user [tadast](https://github.com/tadast) under the [GitHub standard terms and conditions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service).
